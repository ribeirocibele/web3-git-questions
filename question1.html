    <h1> Answer to Question 1 </h1>

    <h3>Git Advantages:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Flexibility</li>

        <p>One advantage of Git DVCS over Dropbox is Flexibility:</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Developers can push their changes continuously.</li>
            <li>After push changes and pull codes, developers can share codes with other developers.</li>
            <li>Integrators can review and bring changes to the reference repository code asynchronous</li>
            <li>Users can work locally, and work disconnected.</li>
        </ul>

        <p align="justify"> When we create a git repository git initializes it as branch which calls a master and as long we keep on creating
            commits or save points, we continue to grow our master branch. Developers can work on separate parts of the project
            without disturbing one or other, once those are finished the feature branch can merge into the development branch
            creating a new save point. In addition, to being able to create save points and manage the project with other brands,
            it also has the features that the information can be pushed to a location work that can be accessed by other developers,
            so they can copy the information and begin contributing to the project as well, this module allows each developer
            involved in the project to have their own copy of the entire repository, while the same time contributing to the project
            by pushing their changes to central repository and copy any changes from other developers from the central repository</p>
        <p> In conclusion, Git makes collaboration very efficient, with Git users have the ability to make save points, work of their
            branches, create branches to merge new features and create local copies of the entire repository on  their local  machine
            as well share between multiple developers throw a central repository</p>



        <li>Traceability</li>
        <p align="justify">Another advantage of Git DVCS over Dropbox is traceability. Every project involves many steps, developers can change a file many
            times, and each of these steps is a new version of the project. Using a Version Control System as Git, users can save these
            versions, and any time later they can have a look at each version and see what was changed. Whereas using Dropbox, it does not
            save the project history, what was modified. If there is a change in the file, that will be the latest file, users can not recover
            the previous version.</p>
        <p align="justify">A Version Control System solves these issues. Git DVCS saves changes in a professional way, it does not need extra folder or
            complete copies of the project, it handles the changes in a very efficient and transparent way. When saving a new version,
            it also saves when those changes were made and by whom, only requires is a message that describes the changes, so developers
            and co-workers will understand they later. </p>
    </ol>
