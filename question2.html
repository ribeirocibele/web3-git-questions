    <h1> Answer to Question 2 </h1>

<p align="justify">GIT is version control software that can be operated in two ways: via a graphical user interface (GUI),
    or through a command line interface (CLI).</p>

<h3>Advantages of Command Line Interface (CLI)</h3>

    <p align="justify">The benefits of the command line in the life of a developer are clear, especially when it comes to
        using Git.</p>

    <ul style="list-style-type:square">

<li>If you need to do something like SSH tunnel into remote servers and run operations, the CLI is the only interface that
    allows you to do it.</li>

        <li>With a simple script you can schedule git commands automatically, letting you do things like update a remote server at
    exactly 2:00am every single day.</li>

        <li>No matter what your development platform, you can use the command line to do what you want. Relatedly, if you look
        for help with Git online, you'll probably find directions for the command line.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Advantages of Graphical user Interface (GUI).</h3>

    <p align="justify">Graphical interfaces can perform many helpful functions for the active developer.</p>

    <ul style="list-style-type:square">

        <li>A GUI can save you many lines of code with a drag-and-drop or the push of a button</li>

        <li>GUIs help take care of a lot of work that can be obscure. GUIs help present the user
            with advanced options that they might not know exist otherwise </li>

        <li>The barrier-of-entry for GUIs is much lower than for the command line. Novice developers can become
            effective faster and can ultimately get more done.
        </li>

        <li> GUIs are best able to graphically represent collaboration. Branches, changes to branches,
            teammate activity, and other such information is best conveyed visually.
        </li>

    </ul>
