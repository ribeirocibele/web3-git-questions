    <h1> Answer to Question 2 </h1>

<p align="justify">GIT is version control software that can be operated in two ways: via a graphical user interface (GUI),
    or through a command line interface (CLI).</p>

<h3>Advantages of Command Line Interface (CLI)</h3>

    <p align="justify">The benefits of the command line in the life of a developer are clear, especially when it comes to
        using Git.</p>

    <ul style="list-style-type:square">

<li>If you need to do something like SSH tunnel into remote servers and run operations, the CLI is the only interface that
    allows you to do it.</li>

        <li>With a simple script you can schedule git commands automatically, letting you do things like update a remote server at
    exactly 2:00am every single day.</li>

        <li>No matter what your development platform, you can use the command line to do what you want. Relatedly, if you look
        for help with Git online, you'll probably find directions for the command line.</li>
        </ul>
